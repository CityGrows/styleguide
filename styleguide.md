# CityGrows Company and Team Communication Guidelines

All of our work at CityGrows is informed by our mission and our values.  If you’re not sure about how to address a situation, respond to something, or prioritize your activities, refer back to these foundational goals.  

**Mission:** CityGrows will transform and improve the way local government works.

**Vision:**  Through CityGrows, all local governments now have access to low-cost, effective tools that prioritize open data and transparency, while making government work better.  It’s as easy to track a business permit as a package, and that results in performance-based management and accountability. People feel more connected to government because government works better.  Government processes are faster, cheaper, and more flexible.

**Values:** CityGrows strives to be:
Transparent/ open (corporate processes as well as open data)
Collaborative/ Responsive/ communicative - empathize with and adapt to customer, team member, and community needs
Fair/ equitable - 
Iterative/ agile/ nimble
Data-driven and evaluative/ experimental
Fun
Compassionate/ kind
Positive/ optimistic

## Tone

In our internal and external communications, our goal is to embody our values.  Our tone is positive, friendly, informative - we strive to never be condescending, snarky, or bad-tempered.  We are polite and express gratitude and appreciation frequently.  When we have to give critical feedback, we consider the potential tone and impact of our communication and seek to stress ways to improve and solve problems, rather than dwelling on negative aspects of internal or external dynamics.  That being said, we understand that difficult conversations and situations are an inevitable part of working closely together on ambitious goals, so we approach them with an atmosphere of respect and seek to create an atmosphere of psychological safety.  We value discussion, different opinions, and strong views expressed respectfully.  We call each other out when we need it, and most importantly we appreciate everyone’s work. If someone is being awesome, make sure they know it! 

## Content
It’s our goal to be consistent in the way we describe/ present CityGrows.  Text on our website is a good source of language to use to describe the company and product, and we will be creating talking points docs and other materials as needed to support outward communication.  Feel free to request or draft something for team review if you can’t find a description of something about the company or product already written.

## Grammar, Style and Text

Use good stylistic practices on grammar, formatting, and capitalization for anything that has a degree of permanence like formal documents, CRM tags, external emails, blog posts, etc. (as opposed to less permanent things like internal emails, Slack messages)
If you’re picking a font, consider using PT Sans (the font used on our platform). It’s okay if another font works better, but generally PT Sans is a more appropriate choice than another sans-serif body font like Arial.

## Communication / tracking methods

Try to avoid sending internal emails. Slack is almost always less disruptive and more effective.
For external communications, we’re guided by the methods that our clients prefer - so some clients may work best with phone calls, others with emails, etc.  Try and understand which methods which work best with each client.
Don’t be afraid to be persistent and pick up the phone.  Our short- and long-term success depends on growing our list of clients quickly.  We are respectfully and pleasantly persistent, because we’re offering an incredible and FREE set of tools to local governments.
Log all relevant external contacts in Prosperworks, so our monthly tracking reports are accurate.
Each client or potential client should have one main point of contact with CityGrows, with a few major exceptions (Santa Monica).  Check prosperworks before conducting any cold outreach to a new contact or following up with a warm contact to see if there is any existing history with that person or organization.
If you have something to share that you think the whole company would be interested in, but you don’t need a response from anyone, post it to team.citygro.ws
Email signatures should have your mobile phone number and the company twitter handle included
We use Dropbox as our storage system - anything permanent that needs to be kept/ memorialized (e.g. legal docs, contracts, major contract deliverables) and we use google docs to collaborate on our working docs.  Story any CityGrows-related documents and work product on the google drive - and as we get bigger we’ll probably need an organizing principle for those documents.

## Collaboration/ management

We value the standup/ retro team communication model.  Do your best to be attend team meetings.
Everyone should try and have at least one 1:1 conversation with your manager (Catherine with Stephen, Vyki with Catherine, Stephen with an advisor who will be helpful)
We love hanging out and coworking in person, but we believe that our team can function effectively remotely.
Our team members are recruited because of their ability to work independently with integrity and effectiveness. We don’t track hours, we track deliverables. How and when you work s up to you, as long as deliverables are met in a timely manner and any potential issues, questions, or problems are promptly brought to the team’s attention.
Don’t assign “microtasks” to other people. It just makes everyone less productive.
BAD: “Hey did you book that meeting with Emily?” “No, I don’t have her email. Can you send it to me?”
GOOD: “Hey did you book that meeting with Emily?” “No, but I’m on it! Where can I find her email?”
